## Running a full local instance

There are three parts to a local instance. One part is the Nuxt server
contained in this folder, which renders the front-end of the site. The
other two parts are a PostgreSQL database, and an API server which is
contained in the ../api folder.

To run a full local instance, we need to:

1. set up and run PostgreSQL
2. set up and run the API server
3. set the ```LOCAL_API_URL``` environment variable to http://127.0.0.1:8000
4. run the Nuxt server using ```yarn dev```

### PostgreSQL database

The full details about how to set up a local PostgreSQL database are
beyond the scope of this readme, and are well documented elsewhere.
The short version is this:

* Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and
  [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/install/) using whatever mechanism
  youâ€™re comfortable with. Linux package managers and Docker are both
  convenient options.
* Make sure the credentials are set up so that a local process can
  have read/write access to an empty database on that PostgreSQL
  server.
* Make sure the PostgreSQL server is running.


### Install Rust

The API server requires a local installation of
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), which can be easily installed
using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) or various package managers.

Once Rust is installed, you should have access to a command line
program called Cargo. You can check by running:

    cargo --version

### Running Migrations

We'll need to run database migrations before we can launch the API
server. It may also be necessary to run migrations in the future as
well, if the structure of the database is changed.

To run migrations, we need to first install the SQLX command line tool:

    cargo install sqlx-cli

That tool only needs to be installed once, although the same command
can be used to update it if a new version is released.

Once sqlx-cli is installed, we can open a command line in the backend/common folder and run the actual migrations:

    sqlx migrate run

### API server

To run the API server, we need to set some environment variables:


| variable           | value                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DOMAIN             | Set this to the domain to use for cookies and such. Defaults to localhost if not set.                                                                                     |
| DATABASE_URL       | Set this to the database URL which will allow the API server to access the PostgreSQL database. For example: ```DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1/circuit-api``` |
| JWT_SIGNING_KEY    | Set this to some random value. For example: ```JWT_SIGNING_KEY=example-key```                                                                                             |
| SUPERUSER_EMAIL    | Set this to the email address you want to use for accessing the [management area](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/manage/) of your local install.                            |
| SUPERUSER_PASSWORD | Set this to the password you want to use for accessing the management area.                                                                                               |
| INTERNAL_UID       | Set this to any valid UUID, e.g. f13ca90f-5e71-40c3-9a90-f53486698721                                                                                                     |

Now we can run the server opening a command line window in the backend folder and doing:

    cargo run

The first time you do a cargo run, it might take a while to complete,

as it downloads and compiles dependencies. Subsequent runs will be
almost instantaneous, unless the API server code has been updated, in
which case it will need to recompile the changed parts.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
