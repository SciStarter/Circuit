The interns will work beside NASA and other aerospace subject matter experts analyzing and visualizing data. Through a combination of scientific knowledge and hands-on experiences, interns engage in authentic NASA research through field investigations and data analysis. They also strengthen systems design thinking, collaboration, and communication, while developing the technical skills required to succeed in multiple career pathways, from skilled trades to advanced research and engineering.","The SEES Summer Intern Program is a nationally competitive STEM experience for high school students hosted by the University of Texas Center for Space Research. Interns collaborate with NASA, academic, and industry experts using mission data across disciplines such as aerospace, astronomy, planetary science, remote sensing, microgravity research, and space geodetic techniques. Projects are mission-based and aligned with national aerospace priorities, giving students the opportunity to build technical expertise in areas including data analysis, engineering design, and systems modeling. Through this research, interns also strengthen teamwork, communication, and professional skills critical to the nation‚Äôs future science and engineering workforce, while contributing to studies of Earth systems and natural hazards.",,,"Out of School Time Program",Competition,Free,16,18,Indoors,"Engineering, Astronomy and Space, Design, Education, Geology and Earth Science, Physics, Technology",Yes,"high school internship, high school internships, STEM internship, STEM internships for high school students, NASA internship, NASA high school internship, summer internship for teens, summer STEM program, STEM summer camp, competitive high school internships, national high school internship program, research internship for teens, high school science internship, engineering internship for high school students, aerospace internship, space science internship, Earth science internship, data science internship for teens, geospatial internship, GIS internship for students, climate science internship, astrophysics internship, remote sensing internship, satellite data internship, Python coding internship, coding for high school students, machine learning internship for teens, data analysis training for students, scientific research experience, STEM enrichment program, STEM pathways, STEM opportunities for teens, space research program, NASA STEM program, STEM outreach program, high school research program, STEM mentorship, student research experience, pre-college STEM program, college readiness STEM, hands-on STEM experience, STEM career pipeline, STEM workforce development, STEM for all, diversity in STEM, STEM opportunities for underrepresented students, no-cost STEM internship, free STEM program for students, virtual STEM internship, online STEM internship, hybrid internship program, national virtual internship, summer research experience, teen STEM opportunities, high school scholars program, high school leadership program, STEM leadership for students, STEM experiential learning, STEM field experience, science internship program, engineering pathways for teens, future engineers, future scientists, STEM careers for students, STEM professional development for youth, high school academic enrichment, student innovation program, student STEM competitions, youth research training, STEM education program, national STEM experience, STEM talent pipeline, STEM educator mentorship, college prep internship, competitive STEM program, STEM curriculum extension, academic summer programs, NASA student program, NASA workforce pipeline, Earth & space science education, youth space education, satellite science for students, environmental science internship, sustainability internship for teens, tech internship high school, high school data internship, student internship program, STEM skill development, experiential STEM learning",,,,,86fe1b48-24be-47b5-a07e-98c642cf3921,Crossdivisional,,"Astrophysics, Earth science, planetary science, biological and physical",,,,
