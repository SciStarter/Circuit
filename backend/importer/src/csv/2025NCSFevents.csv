<p>North Carolina is feeling the impacts of a changing climate from massive storms in the mountains creating unimaginable levels of flooding and destruction, to the slower more insidious creep of rising ocean tides on our coast. Across the state, returning things to a natural state is increasing resiliency and connection to nature in communities locatedÂ along our rivers, swamps, and coast.Â </p>
<p>Following the screening, Michelle Lotker, the producer of<em>Â State of Change</em>, willÂ host a panel of climate scientists and experts working on climate change issues at a community level for a lively discussion. The panel will also answer questions from the audience at the museum and online.</p>

<p>Last year, skywatchers around across North America were treated to spectacular displays of Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights in Earthâ€™s atmosphere. These are caused by eruptions on the faraway surface of our Sun. Roughly every eleven years a spike occurs in solar activityÂ as the Sun prepares to flip its magnetic poles. The number of giant (Earth-sized, even Jupiter-sized!) sunspots increases dramatically during this period. Throughout the 2025 period of Solar Maximum, Imperial Centre education staff and experienced observers from the Tar River Astronomy Club will safely display these giant sunspots for you, using our Sunspotter solar viewers and help you to directly observe the Sun through a specially-filtered solar telescope. A special Hydrogen-Alpha telescope will allow us to safely view giant erruptions of gas from the solar surface and flares along the Sun's visible edge. Join us and be amazed at a totally safe, close-up view of our nearest star. (Caution: Never look directly at the Sun.)</p>

<p>Discovering Infant Exoplanets, Madyson Barber, UNC-Chapel Hill</p>
<p>About the Talk: Astronomers have detected more than a dozen planets transiting stars that are 10â€“40 million years old but reaching younger proved challenging. The lack of such discoveries may be because planets have not fully formed at this age or because our view is blocked by the disk of material that formed it. The warped outer disk surrounding the host star enabled the discovery of IRAS 04125+2902 b (or TIDYE-1b). At just 3 million years old, TIDYE-1b is the youngest transiting planet known to date and is a powerful environment for understanding infant planets.</p>
<p>About the Speaker: Madyson Barber is a PhD student at the UniversityÂ of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. She works on the discovery and characterization of young (< 1 billion-year-old) transiting exoplanets to better understand how planets form and evolve. She is an NSF Graduate Research Fellow and recently published a paper inÂ <em>Nature</em>Â on the discovery of the youngest transiting planet known to date.</p>

<li>2:00 pm â€“ Rock On at Hanging Rock!Â We will take a short hike with a park educator/geologist to find out about the geology and why hanging rock sticks up above the surrounding country side. Can the state rock can be found here too?</li>

We will discuss identification techniques, cooking methods, foraging ethics, and medicinal preparations, leaving time to admire the non-edible plants and mushrooms as well! This event is geared towards beginner foragers or those interested in foraging who are looking for a place to start, but is open to nature lovers, hikers, and chefs of all knowledge and skill levels. Please note that we will not be harvesting anything during this walk, and foraging on Mainspring Conservation Trust properties is by permission only.</p>
<p>The Forest Therapy Trail at Pinnacle Park is about 1 mile long and ranked as moderate. There are roots and rocks in the trail to avoid, and we will descend down a steeper section with loose rock for the final portion of the hike.Â We will meet in theÂ parking lot of Pinnacle ParkÂ (end of Fischer Creek Rd) in Sylva justÂ before 5:00pm on Friday, April 11th. <a href=""https://www.mainspringconserves.org/events/spring-foraging-hike/"">See website for exact location</a>. We suggest bringing water, a snack, layers, sturdy hiking shoes, and any naturalist tools you may want such as a notebook or a hand lens.</p>

These meetings are social gatherings with naturalist twists rather than structured workshops; our main goal is to enjoy our time together in the beautiful outdoors, including sharing a provided snack together! In between our chatting and laughter, we take the time to notice, appreciate, and learn about the creatures that call this place home, from the tiny beetles to the mighty trees. This safe space is open to anyone who seeks community and honors the spirit of respect and kindness that this club is built on -- friends, family, and allies are welcome!</p>
<p>This month, we will beÂ Out in Franklin to welcome the migratory birds back to town! Some of these birds are just passing through on their way farther north, and some are stopping here in WNC to nest. Regardless of their final destinations, this is a fantastic time of year to see a wide variety of beautiful warblers and other colorful feathered friends.

Space law is an emerging field as many nations are extending there influence beyond what lies on earth. The Red Cross Youth Action Campaign at UNC-Chapel Hill presents a speaker series on ""Space Law and Armed Conflict,"" featuring experts in international law, military ethics, and space policy. The panel will include Phil Cameron, a renowned legal expert on space law; General Dunlap, a retired military officer with extensive experience in the intersection of armed conflict and legal frameworks; Johnathan Wiener, a distinguished scholar specializing in the regulation of emerging technologies and their implications for warfare; and Faith Austin, a Robertson scholar at UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke University studying history and international comparative studies, and an ROTC cadet. Together, they will engage in a thought-provoking discussion about the evolving challenges and legal considerations of warfare in outer space, emphasizing the importance of upholding international humanitarian law in this new frontier. This event promises to offer valuable insights for young leaders interested in the future of both space exploration and conflict resolution in this developing field.</p>
