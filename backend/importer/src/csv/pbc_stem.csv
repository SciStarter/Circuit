SPEAKER BIO: Michele Hoffman Trotter is a Fellow of the Explorers Club and an award-winning educator with advanced degrees in Marine Science from the University of New South Wales and law from DePaul University. At sixteen, she took her first life-altering breath on SCUBA, and by twenty-three she was a fully hooked PADI instructor. Michele has worked with audiences of diverse backgrounds at Sydney Aquarium and the John G. Shedd Aquarium of Chicago, and has served as a science communicator with several important entities including the University of Alaska College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences, the United States Coast Guard, Celebration of the Sea and the Hawaii Association for Marine Education and Research. Michele is currently a faculty member at Roosevelt University, School of the Art Institute and Columbia College of Chicago where she teaches a variety of courses from traditional ocean sciences to sustainability classes that encompass law, policy and ethics. At the core of her teaching philosophy is the belief that there is an inner scientist in everyone. Most recently, Michele has been splitting her time between Chicago and Alaska with husband Bob and son Ryan (also avid ocean enthusiasts) who share in her research and travel adventures!",ANGARI Foundation,Amanda Waite,education@angari.org,https://angari.org/future-at-sea,Online,Online,Online,1/9/2025,1:30:00 PM,Science Communications,0,Yes,https://angari.org/future-at-sea
