11/17/2025 19:37,Beach Comber Science Class,"Join the River Center for our new Beach Comber class!

Have you ever seen something at the beach and wondered what it was? Could it be a shell, a seed, or is it a mermaid’s purse? In this class at the River Center, we will explore all the different things you can find at the beach, how they got there, and how they are related. Learn how to think like a field scientist and record data as well. Take home journaling sheets to help you remember what you know the next time you are at the beach! This is an indoor class at the River Center.

Registration is required to attend.
