https://angari.org/marine-protected-areas

Lindy Knowles of Bahamas National Trust discusses his data-driven work to conserve marine resources through the establishment, monitoring and management of Marine Protected Areas.

#OceanExpertExchange webinars delve into marine science, technology and conservation topics with subject-matter experts. Co-hosted by ANGARI Foundation and the Scientist in Every Florida School initiative, Ocean Expert Exchange events welcome audiences of all ages and include a brief presentation on the featured topic followed by Q&A with the audience. Event livestreams are accessible via Zoom (recommended, but pre-registration required) and YouTube.

SPEAKER BIO:
Lindy Knowles is a conservation ecologist who works as a technical officer at the Bahamas National Trust’s Science & Policy division collecting in situ data to help ensure that the protected areas are managed through science-driven conservation. Lindy works towards the expansion and effective management of the protected areas system of The Bahamas, collaborating with, and leading teams that survey reef, mangrove, and seagrass to determine health, and using conservation technology such as GIS to map boundaries and visualize field data to support the work being done in communities to ensure that vulnerable areas and species are considered within a protected area system. As head of the GIS Unit, Lindy is responsible for implementing innovative technology into the organization to help increase management effectiveness. He has collected imagery using drones and underwater cameras that are processed to create models of terrestrial and marine environments which have been used in the creation of habitat classes via remote sensing, as well as 3D models showing elevation on land and depths of the sea below. This work has led to the expansion of the marine protected area (MPA) system as part of The Bahamas’ goal of protecting 20% of its nearshore environment. Lindy earned a Master of Philosophy in Conservation Leadership from the University of Cambridge and a Master of Science degree in Natural Resource and Environmental Management in a Coastal and Marine Environment from the University of the West Indies at Cave Hill.",ANGARI Foundation,Amanda Waite,education@angari.org,https://angari.org/marine-protected-areas,Online,Online,https://angari.org/marine-protected-areas,4/10/2025,1:30:00 PM,Science Communications,0,Yes,https://angari.org/marine-protected-areas,,,,,,,
City Nature Challenge - Shoreline BioBlitz!,"Happy Earth Month from The Nature Conservancy's Blowing Rocks Preserve!

We're celebrating by taking part in the City Nature Challenge, an international community science effort to identify and document species found all over the world. It’s a bioblitz-style competition rooted in community science where cities or regions are in a contest against each other to see who can make the most observations of nature, who can find the most species, and who can engage the most people. ​

Blowing Rocks Preserve's bioblitz event will involve seine netting in the Indian River Lagoon to collect and identify marine species, as well as a guided walk along the lagoon shoreline to identify plants or animals we may see there!

No prior experience is required to participate. All necessary equipment will be supplied by The Nature Conservancy.

*Light to moderate physical activity.
*Recommended for ages 6+, all youth under the age of 18 years old must be accompanied by an adult.

We recommend downloading the iNaturalist app or iSeek app (kid version), in advance, on a device that you'll be bringing with you to the bioblitz. This will help you document and identify the species you encounter.

Please be aware that this event will be taking place in waist-deep or shallower water. There are rocks, urchins, shells, and more on the lagoon floor, and water shoes required. Please come prepared for the Florida heat, sun, and insects by wearing sun protection and bug spray if necessary. Please bring proper supplies to protect your device from water.

Advance registration is required for this event as space is limited.

ALL REGISTERED PARTICIPANTS WILL RECEIVE A CONFIRMATION EMAIL/PHONE CALL THE WEEK OF THE EVENT TO CONFIRM YOUR SPOT(S). IF THERE ARE LESS THAN 10 CONFIRMED ATTENDEES, THIS EVENT MAY BE CANCELLED.

*Registration will close on Thursday, April 24 at 11:30 p.m.
